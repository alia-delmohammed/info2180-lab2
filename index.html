        <h2>My University Experience</h2>
        <h3>...thus far</h3>
        <p class = "Date-Author"> October 2, 2022 by Alia Delmohammed </p>
        <p>After being in limbo about which university to attend and what degree to pursue for quite some time, fate somehow decide that it would be UWI and Computer Science with a minor in Geography. I approached the first semester of my first year all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed ready to take on the teritiary experience that I've always heard about and watched in movies. Somehow I thought that I'd be excelling in every aspect effortlessly, little did I know that the transition between university and high school wouldn't be as effortless as I thought. The lectures, labs, projects, assignments, quizzes and exams really "lick me fi six". I was significantly humbled and had to learn to adapt quickly. </p>
        <p>Skip a few pages and now we're here. An average university student who cannot yet do great things so she's doing small things in a great way. I've learned to value the small wins and keep working towards the big ones because it's these small wins which motivates me and makes me feel as though I'm reaching somewhere in this rat race of life.
